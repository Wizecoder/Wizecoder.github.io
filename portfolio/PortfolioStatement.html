      <p>This first quarter I have spent here at the University of Washington has been an enlightening experience.
I have learned a lot about myself, my strengths, and my weaknesses. Initially when I went into this, I had
no idea how hard the classes were going to be, what would be expected of me, etc&#8230; And admittedly, I was
a bit cocky. Although I homeschooled instead of going to high school, I have always done well in standardized
tests, I have always read at a fairly high level, and I have always taken pride in being a grade or two ahead in math.
But during this first quarter the difficulty has definitely begun to set in: I was a bit lazy in practicing for my second
calculus midterm and my performance was poorer than I was hoping, I have been struggling to keep up with
my readings for philosophy, and admittedly, I am somewhat terrified of finals coming up. I now recognize
that, although I&#8217;m not exactly lazy, my work ethic could do with some improvement if I hope to achieve my goals.</p>

<p>But my realizations haven&#8217;t all been negative. I now have a better idea of how much time I should expect
to put into studying to improve my scores, and I think that I will be more than capable of putting that time in with just
a bit more focus. I have also gotten a better feeling of where I stand in comparison with other students and the
sort of grades I should expect for myself. All in all, academically I feel that I have grown and matured
in these last two and a half months, and I feel better for it.</p>

<p>This first quarter has also greatly helped me confirm and clarify my goals and plans for the next two and a half years.
I haven&#8217;t had any revelations that have caused me to want to change majors or anything like that, but forcing myself
to take a good hard look at exactly what I want to do to fulfill my requirements for my &#8220;four-year plan&#8221; has been
incredibly useful. And, now that I know more about the various experiential learning opportunities that are
available, I feel much more confident about my options. I hope to pursue research as my main project, of course
I don&#8217;t yet know <em>what</em> I will be researching, but I know that there are plenty of options available in the
computer science department. For my other experiential learning project though, I&#8217;m still not sure. Because sadly
I don&#8217;t think that studying abroad will work well with my plans, I am considering becoming a TA, but I will also
take a look at the volunteer opportunities at a local animal shelter.</p>

<p>Overall, this has been a good quarter. I have made a few friends, I have begun to settle in, and, although I still
look forward to heading home for the holidays, Seattle and the University of Washington are beginning to feel
like home.</p>
